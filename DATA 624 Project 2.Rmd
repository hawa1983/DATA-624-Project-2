## Summarize numerical variables and investigate missing values

### Notable Observations:

1. **Mnf.Flow**: Highly skewed with a wide range (-100.20 to 229.40) and a very high standard deviation (119.48), indicating significant variability.
2. **Carb.Flow**: Extremely skewed with a wide range (26.00 to 5104.00) and a high standard deviation (1073.70), suggesting potential outliers.
3. **Filler.Speed**: Large spread (998.00 to 4030.00) with a substantial standard deviation (770.82), indicating significant variability across samples.
4. **Hyd.Pressure1, Hyd.Pressure2, Hyd.Pressure3**: All exhibit high skewness with notable ranges and standard deviations (e.g., `Hyd.Pressure1`: -0.80 to 58.00, SD = 12.43), likely requiring transformation.
5. **MFR**: Missing values are notable (8.25%), with a moderately wide range (31.40 to 868.60) and standard deviation (73.90), indicating some variability.

### Recommendations:
- Apply transformations (e.g., log or Box-Cox) for skewed variables (`Carb.Flow`, `Mnf.Flow`, `Hyd.Pressure*`) to normalize distributions.
- Investigate outliers for variables with large ranges and high variability (`Carb.Flow`, `Filler.Speed`).
- Address missingness in `MFR` due to its notable percentage (8.25%).

## Visualize missing values
1. **High Missingness (e.g., `MFR` ~8%)**: Use **predictive imputation** methods like MICE (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) or KNN to estimate values based on patterns in other variables.

2. **Low to Moderate Missingness (<5%)**:
   - **Continuous Variables**: Use **mean imputation** for normally distributed data and **median imputation** for skewed data (e.g., `PC.Volume`, `Fill.Ounces`).

## Summary of categorical variables

The `Brand.Code` variable has 5 unique levels, no missing values, and a mode of `B` (48.19%). It shows moderate entropy (1.93) and a high imbalance ratio (10.32), indicating a skewed distribution.

## Investigate relationship between Brand Code and PH

There is a statistically significant relationship between **Brand_Code** and **PH** based on the provided analyses. We will therefore retain Brand.Code as a variables:

### Summary Statistics
The mean, median, and standard deviation of **PH** vary across the different levels of **Brand_Code**, indicating differences in central tendency and variability.

### ANOVA
The ANOVA results show a significant F-statistic with a p-value less than 0.05 (\(p < 2.2 \times 10^{-16}\)), which suggests that there are statistically significant differences in the mean **PH** values across the levels of **Brand_Code**.

### Boxplots
The boxplots illustrate visible differences in the distributions of **PH** for each **Brand_Code**. These differences reinforce the findings from the summary statistics and ANOVA.

### Chi-Square Test (Categorized PH)
When **PH** is categorized into levels such as "Low," "Medium," and "High," the Chi-Square test also indicates a significant association (\(p < 2.2 \times 10^{-16}\)). However, the warning about the Chi-Square approximation suggests caution in interpretation, potentially due to sparse data in some categories.

### Conclusion
The statistical evidence supports a relationship between **Brand_Code** and **PH**. These findings could inform further modeling, such as including **Brand_Code** as a categorical predictor in statistical or machine learning models.

### Step 1: Statistical Summary by Group
```{r}
# Summary of PH by Brand_Code
summary_stats <- aggregate(PH ~ Brand.Code, 
                           data = train_set, 
                           FUN = function(x) c(mean = mean(x), 
                                               median = median(x), 
                                               sd = sd(x)))

# Convert the result into a more readable data frame
summary_df <- do.call(data.frame, summary_stats)

# Rename the columns for better understanding
colnames(summary_df) <- c("Brand_Code", "PH_Mean", "PH_Median", "PH_SD")

# Print the summary
print(summary_df)

```

### Step 2: Perform ANOVA
```{r}
# Perform ANOVA
anova_result <- aov(PH ~ Brand.Code, data = train_set)
summary(anova_result)
```

### Step 3: Create Boxplots
```{r}
# Visualize using boxplots
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(train_set, aes(x = Brand.Code, y = PH)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of PH by Brand Code", x = "Brand Code", y = "PH") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Step 4: Chi-Square Test (If PH is Categorized)
```{r}
# Convert PH to categorical (if needed)
train_set$PH_cat <- cut(train_set$PH, breaks = 3, labels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))

# Function to calculate mode
get_mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- na.omit(unique(x))
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
}

# Impute missing values in PH_cat with the mode
mode_PH_cat <- get_mode(train_set$PH_cat)
train_set$PH_cat[is.na(train_set$PH_cat)] <- mode_PH_cat


# Perform Chi-Square Test between Brand.Code and PH_cat
chisq_test <- chisq.test(table(train_set$Brand.Code, train_set$PH_cat))
print(chisq_test)

```


## Impute Missing Values

The imputation methods applied in the script are outlined below, incorporating the specialized treatment of the **Brand_Code** variable and handling scenarios where the target variable (`PH`) is unavailable in the evaluation set:

**Imputation Methods Summary**:

1. **Numeric Variables**:
   - **Predictive Mean Matching (PMM)** was used for numeric variables, implemented via the `mice` package.
   - Missing values were imputed by predicting plausible values based on observed data patterns, ensuring realistic and consistent imputations across variables.

2. **Categorical Variables (`Brand_Code`)**:
   - **Brand_Code**:
     - For the **training set**, missing values in `Brand_Code` were imputed using a **multinomial logistic regression model** with `PH` as the predictor. This method leverages the observed relationship between `Brand_Code` and `PH` to provide accurate and contextually appropriate imputations.
     - For the **evaluation set** (where `PH` is unavailable), missing values in `Brand_Code` were imputed using **mode-based imputation**. The most frequent category from the training data was assigned to ensure consistency while addressing the absence of a predictor.

3. **Exclusions**:
   - The variable `PH` was explicitly excluded from imputation in the `evaluation_set` as its values are missing by design, representing the target variable to be predicted.
   - Any remaining missing values for `PH` were excluded from the final missing values report, as they are not subject to imputation.

## Visualize Imputed dataset

### **Data Distribution and Characteristics**

The imputed train dataset was analyzed to understand the distributions, skewness, and presence of outliers among its numeric variables. The goal was to identify patterns in the data, such as normality, skewed distributions, and extreme values, while also determining variables with near-zero variance that provide limited analytical value. Below is a summary of the findings:

### **Distribution**
- **Approximately Normal**: Variables such as "Carb.Volume," "Fill.Ounces," and "PSC" exhibit a roughly symmetric distribution, indicating a normal-like pattern.
- **Skewed**: Variables like "Carb.Flow," "Hyd.Pressure3," "Density," and "Balling" display significant asymmetry, indicating skewness in the data.
- **Multimodal**: Variables such as "MFR" and "Filler.Speed" exhibit multiple peaks, suggesting the presence of distinct subgroups or clusters in the data.

### **Skewness**
- **Right-Skewed**: Variables like "Carb.Flow," "Hyd.Pressure3," "MFR," and "Usage.cont" have a longer tail on the right side, indicating higher values are less frequent.
- **Left-Skewed**: Variables such as "PSC.CO2," "Carb.Rel," and "PH" have a longer tail on the left side, with lower values being less frequent.

### **Outliers**
- **Significant Outliers**: Variables including "MFR," "Filler.Speed," "Oxygen.Filler," and "Bowl.Setpoint" have extreme values that deviate from the bulk of the data. These may require further investigation or transformation.

### **Excluded Variables (Near-Zero Variance)**
- Variables like "Carb.Temp" and "Hyd.Pressure1" have extremely low variance, indicating almost no variability across their observations. These were excluded from visualization as they provide limited information for analysis.

## **Box-Cox Transformation: Preparation and Application**

To enhance the quality and suitability of the dataset for statistical and machine learning models, specific preprocessing steps were undertaken. These steps ensure the data meets the requirements for transformations and improves its statistical properties:

- **Adjust for Positive Values**:
  - The Box-Cox transformation requires all input values to be strictly positive. Adjusting non-positive values ensures the transformation can be applied without errors while preserving the integrity of the data.

- **Box-Cox Transformation**:
  - The transformation stabilizes variance and makes the data distribution closer to normal, which is a common assumption for many statistical models. By identifying the optimal lambda for each numeric column, the data was transformed to enhance its suitability for downstream analysis, thereby improving the reliability and performance of statistical and machine learning models.

## Skewness Comparison: Impact of Box-Cox Transformation

- **Overview**:  
  - The visualization compares the skewness of numeric variables before and after applying the Box-Cox transformation, demonstrating its effect on data symmetry.

- **Key Observations**:  
  - **Significant Skewness Reduction**: Variables such as `Hyd.Pressure2`, `Filler.Speed`, and `Carb.Volume` exhibit a substantial decrease in skewness, transitioning to more symmetric distributions conducive to modeling.  
  - **Negligible Changes**: Variables like `Temperature` and `PH`, which already had low skewness, experienced minimal or no transformation effects, reflecting their approximate normality.  

- **Conclusion**:  
  - The Box-Cox transformation is particularly effective for variables with high initial skewness, improving their distribution symmetry. This transformation optimizes the data for statistical analysis and machine learning models that assume normally distributed inputs.

## Remove Near-zero Variance Highly Correlated Variables for Model Suitability

In the dataset, several near-zero variance and highly correlated variables were identified and removed, including `Balling`, `Alch.Rel`, `Balling.Lvl`, `Density`, and others. Removing these variables is crucial for models that are sensitive to multicollinearity or feature redundancy, such as:

- **Linear Regression**: To prevent inflated variance estimates and ensure stable coefficients.
- **Logistic Regression**: To enhance interpretability and maintain prediction accuracy.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: To avoid redundant variables dominating principal components.
- **Regularized Models (e.g., Lasso, Ridge)**: While these models address multicollinearity, removing redundant variables improves computational efficiency.

For **tree-based models** or **non-linear algorithms** (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost), this step is generally unnecessary, as these models are robust to multicollinearity and handle feature interactions inherently.

## Prepare Datasets for Models

Below is the updated R code to prepare datasets for **gradient-based models**, **tree-based models**, and **statistical models**, reflecting the processing steps and appropriate handling of categorical variables like `Brand_Code`:

### 1. Gradient-Based Models (e.g., Neural Networks, SVM, KNN)

For gradient-based models:
- **Min-max scaling** is applied to all numeric variables, including the target variable `PH`.
- **One-hot encoding** is applied to `Brand_Code` without dropping any dummy variables.

```{r}
# Load required libraries
if (!requireNamespace("caret", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("caret")
}
if (!requireNamespace("fastDummies", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("fastDummies")
}

library(caret)
library(fastDummies)

# Min-Max Scaling
gradient_based_data <- filtered_data_final

# Apply Min-Max scaling to all numeric variables
numeric_cols <- names(gradient_based_data)[sapply(gradient_based_data, is.numeric)]
min_max_scaler <- preProcess(gradient_based_data[, numeric_cols], method = "range")
gradient_based_data[, numeric_cols] <- predict(min_max_scaler, gradient_based_data[, numeric_cols])

# One-Hot Encoding without dropping any dummy
gradient_based_data <- dummy_cols(gradient_based_data, 
                                   select_columns = "Brand.Code", 
                                   remove_first_dummy = FALSE, # Keep all dummy variables
                                   remove_selected_columns = TRUE) # Drop the original categorical variable

# Remove PH_cat column
gradient_based_data <- gradient_based_data %>% dplyr::select(-PH_cat)

# Check structure of the final dataset
str(gradient_based_data)
```

### 2. Tree-Based Models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, MARS)

For tree-based models:
- The dataset is used as is, without scaling numeric variables or transforming the target variable `PH`.
- **Label encoding** is applied to the `Brand_Code` variable instead of one-hot encoding.

```{r}
# Label Encoding for Tree-Based Models
tree_based_data <- train_set_boxcox

# Convert Brand_Code to numeric labels
tree_based_data$Brand_Code <- as.numeric(factor(tree_based_data$Brand.Code))

# Remove PH_cat column
tree_based_data <- tree_based_data %>% dplyr::select(-PH_cat)

# Check structure of the final dataset
str(tree_based_data)
```

### 3. Statistical Models (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, PCA)

For statistical models:
- **Standardization** (mean centering and scaling to unit variance) is applied to all numeric variables, including the target variable `PH`.
- **One-hot encoding** is applied to `Brand_Code`, with one dummy variable dropped to avoid multicollinearity.

```{r}
# Standardization
statistical_models_data <- filtered_data_final

# Apply Standardization to all numeric variables
numeric_cols <- names(statistical_models_data)[sapply(statistical_models_data, is.numeric)]
standard_scaler <- preProcess(statistical_models_data[, numeric_cols], method = c("center", "scale"))
statistical_models_data[, numeric_cols] <- predict(standard_scaler, statistical_models_data[, numeric_cols])

# One-Hot Encoding with one dummy dropped
statistical_models_data <- dummy_cols(statistical_models_data, 
                                      select_columns = "Brand.Code", 
                                      remove_first_dummy = TRUE,  # Drop one dummy
                                      remove_selected_columns = TRUE) # Drop the original categorical variable

# Remove PH_cat column
statistical_models_data <- statistical_models_data %>% dplyr::select(-PH_cat)

# Check structure of the final dataset
str(statistical_models_data)
```

## Model Building

### Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Models

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models will be built.

#### Process of OLS Modeling

1. **Data Preparation**: Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate model performance.
2. **Baseline MLR Model**: Fit a multiple linear regression (MLR) model using all available features.
3. **Feature Selection**: Use forward selection, backward elimination, stepwise selection, and recursive feature elimination (RFE) to identify subsets of relevant predictors.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features based on domain knowledge or interactions to improve model performance.
5. **Advanced Models**: Incorporate interaction terms or polynomial features to capture complex relationships between variables.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics like \(R^2\), RMSE, and Test RMSE to identify the best-performing model.

#### OLS Best Model

The **Interaction Terms Model** emerged as the best model with the lowest **Test_RMSE** (0.7320), a relatively high **Train_R2** (0.6343), and a balanced generalization ability. This indicates that incorporating interactions between variables significantly enhances predictive performance.

# Fit a model using RFE-selected predictors
selected_vars <- predictors(rfe_model)
rfe_final_model <- lm(as.formula(paste("PH ~", paste(selected_vars, collapse = " + "))), data = train_data)
rfe_metrics <- evaluate_model(rfe_final_model, train_data, test_data)

#### MLR Best Model Residual Analysis (Interaction Terms Model)

**Residual Diagnostics Statement:**

1. **Residuals vs Fitted Plot**: The residuals exhibit a random scatter around the zero line, indicating linearity. However, some slight heteroscedasticity may be present as the spread of residuals appears to increase slightly for higher fitted values.

2. **Q-Q Plot**: The residuals generally follow the theoretical quantiles, suggesting that the normality assumption is approximately satisfied, though some deviation is observed in the tails.

3. **Scale-Location Plot**: The spread of standardized residuals is relatively consistent across fitted values, supporting the homoscedasticity assumption.

4. **Residuals vs Leverage Plot**: A few high-leverage points are present, as indicated by Cook's distance. These points may influence the model significantly and warrant further investigation.

Overall, the diagnostic plots indicate that the model assumptions are reasonably met, though some high-leverage points may require attention.

```{r}
# Generate diagnostic plots for the training model
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(interaction_model)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))  # Reset plotting layout

summary(interaction_model)
```

### Partial Least Squares (PLS) Models

#### PLS Modeling Process

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - The data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
   - Predictors (`train_X`, `test_X`) and the response variable (`train_y`, `test_y`) were prepared.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - **PLS and PCR**: Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Principal Component Regression (PCR) were trained using cross-validation to select the optimal number of components. Predictions were made for both training and testing datasets, and RMSE and \(R^2\) were calculated.
   - **Ridge and Lasso Regression**: Ridge (alpha=0) and Lasso (alpha=1) regression models were trained using cross-validation to select the optimal regularization parameter (\(\lambda\)). Predictions were made on the datasets, and metrics were computed.
   - **Elastic Net**: Elastic Net, combining Lasso and Ridge, was tuned over a grid of \(\lambda\) and \(\alpha\) values using cross-validation. Predictions and metrics were computed.

3. **Result Compilation**:
   - RMSE and \(R^2\) for both training and testing datasets were consolidated into a DataFrame for all models.
   - Models were ranked by Test RMSE in ascending order.

#### Best Model Selection

Based on the sorted DataFrame output, **Lasso Regression** is the best-performing model, having the lowest Test RMSE (\(0.8078\)) and competitive \(R^2\) values. This suggests that it balances bias and variance effectively for this dataset.

#### Residual Analysis, Variable Importance and Cross-Validation of the Best PLS (Lasso) Model


The diagnostic plots and the cross-validation summary for the Lasso model reveal the following:

1. **Residual Analysis**:
   - The residuals vs. fitted plot indicates no obvious patterns, suggesting that the model does not suffer from severe non-linearity or heteroscedasticity.
   - The Q-Q plot indicates that the residuals approximately follow a normal distribution, with minor deviations at the tails.
   - The scale-location plot (√|Standardized Residuals| vs. Fitted Values) shows that the variance is relatively constant, further supporting the assumption of homoscedasticity.
   - The residuals vs. leverage plot does not show influential points with high leverage, suggesting stability in the model.

2. **Cross-Validation Results**:
   - The optimal lambda value for minimizing mean squared error (MSE) is **0.001266**, which resulted in 23 nonzero predictors being retained in the model.
   - The lambda at the one standard error rule (λ.1se = 0.024844) selects a simpler model with 17 predictors, which sacrifices minimal predictive performance for increased parsimony.

3. **Conclusion**:
   The Lasso model achieves a balance between model complexity and predictive accuracy. It reduces the number of predictors to avoid overfitting while maintaining satisfactory performance metrics. These characteristics make it a robust choice for modeling, especially when interpretability and variable selection are priorities.
   
##### 1. Residual Plots for Best PLS (Lasso) Model

```{r}
# Generate diagnostic plots for the Lasso model
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))  # Set layout for 2x2 plots

# Residuals vs. Fitted

```

##### 1. Variable Importance for Best PLS (Lasso) Model

```{r}
# Extract coefficients for Lasso model
lasso_coefficients <- coef(cv_lasso, s = lasso_lambda)

# Create a data frame for variable importance (absolute coefficients)
importance_df_lasso <- data.frame(
  Variable = rownames(lasso_coefficients),

# Sort by importance

  geom_point() +
  coord_flip() +

  theme_minimal()


```

##### 2. Cross-Validation for Lasso or Elastic Net

For Lasso (`alpha = 1`) or Elastic Net (`0 < alpha < 1`), use the same approach with `glmnet`.

```{r}
# Lasso Regression
cv_lasso <- cv.glmnet(train_X, train_y, alpha = 1)

# Elastic Net
cv_enet <- train(
  x = train_X, y = train_y,
  method = "glmnet",
  tuneGrid = expand.grid(
    alpha = seq(0, 1, by = 0.1),
    lambda = seq(0.001, 0.1, length.out = 10)
  ),
  trControl = trainControl(method = "cv")
)

# Extract Best Model and Plot
plot(cv_lasso, main = "Cross-Validation Profile for Lasso Regression")
```

### Notes:
1. **Performance Matrix:** Includes training and testing RMSE, \(R^2\), and placeholders for AIC and BIC where not applicable.
2. **AIC/BIC:** Not computed for tree-based models because they don't directly provide coefficients and likelihood.
3. **Dependencies:** Ensure that `caret`, `ipred`, `randomForest`, `gbm`, and `xgboost` are installed.

Run each block sequentially to build, test, and evaluate the models. Let me know if you encounter any issues!
